- 	Additional Information

1. 	Have implemented the code such that, it will terminate gracefully if the input file is incorrect. Please consider for extra credit.

2. 	Have implemented an improved version of manhattan distance, use -IMD to use it. eg. ./CS561A1.exe -Astar -IMD <file>. But it cant be
	with the other heuristic which will run with -AltH.

3.	Files in zip file are : main.cc, BFS.cc, DFS.cc, UCS.cc, Astar.cc, project1.h, Makefile, CS561A1Written.pdf

4.	Number of Nodes expanded are the number of grid nodes.
